            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am currently a student pursuing a B.Tech in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science. My passion lies in web development, where I have developed a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I'm also actively expanding my skill set, learning new technologies and frameworks to enhance my capabilities as a web developer.

                Although I am still in the early stages of my journey and have yet to gain professional experience, I am dedicated to honing my skills and applying them to real-world projects. In addition to web development, I have a good understanding of Python, which further strengthens my technical background.
                
                My ultimate goal is to become a proficient web developer, creating innovative and impactful web applications. I am committed to continuous learning and growth in this ever-evolving field.
